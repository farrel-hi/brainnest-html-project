According to Chat GPT:

Based on the instructions provided, you need to create a website that presents information 
about your hobby, favorite books, movies, or any other subject that you are passionate about. 
The website should contain a few pages that are interconnected by links, allowing the user to 
navigate through the site and access different levels of information.

To begin, you should create a homepage that introduces the user to your site and provides a 
clear overview of what they can expect to find there. You could include a brief description 
of your hobby or favorite subject, along with some images or graphics to make the page more 
visually appealing.

Next, you should create a separate page that lists the different categories or topics that 
you will be covering on your site. This page should contain links to each of the individual 
pages where you will be presenting detailed information about each subject.

Each individual page should contain a description of the topic, including both text and 
images. You may want to include additional links on each page, leading to more detailed 
information about specific aspects of the topic.

As an added bonus, you could make each list element on your category page into a link, 
allowing users to click through to the corresponding page where they can find additional 
information about that particular subject. Additionally, you can incorporate images into your 
website to enhance the user experience, but you should be careful not to overdo it and make 
sure that the images are relevant to the content of your site.
